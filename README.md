# Flask File Upload Web Server

This is a simple web server built using **Flask** that allows users to upload and access files remotely. The server is accessible from anywhere in the world via a public URL generated by **Ngrok**. The uploaded files are stored in a local directory and can be accessed and downloaded by users at any time.

## Features

- **File Uploads**: Users can upload files via a simple web form.
- **File Downloads**: Once uploaded, files are listed with download links.
- **Remote Access**: The server is made accessible globally using **Ngrok**, so anyone with the provided URL can upload and download files.
- **Cross-Platform**: The application can be run on any machine that supports Python and Flask (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: The application is built with Python 3.
- **Ngrok**: Used for exposing the local Flask server to the public internet.
- **Flask**: The Python web framework for building the application.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python 3

If Python 3 is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify the installation by running:
```bash
python3 --version
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

This application uses **Flask** for the web server. Install it using **pip** (Python package installer):

```bash
pip3 install flask
```

### 3. Install Ngrok

**Ngrok** is used to expose the Flask application to the internet. You can install Ngrok from the official website: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download).

After installation, verify Ngrok by running:

```bash
ngrok version
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Start the Flask Application

Navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located and run the following command to start the Flask server:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

By default, the Flask server will start on port 8000.

### 3. Start Ngrok

In a separate terminal window, expose the Flask app to the internet using Ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

This will provide you with a public URL, like:
```
https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app
```

### 4. Upload and Access Files

- Open the public Ngrok URL in any web browser.
- Use the file upload form to upload files. Once uploaded, the files will appear in the list below the form, and you can download them by clicking on the respective file links.

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── myenv
├── uploads/            # The main Flask application file
└── app.py              # Folder where uploaded files are stored
```

- **`app.py`**: Contains the Flask server code that handles file uploads and serves files.
- **`uploads/`**: Directory where files uploaded by users are stored.

## Security Considerations

- **No Authentication**: This server does not implement any authentication, meaning anyone with the Ngrok URL can upload and download files. For production usage, consider adding security measures like password protection or token-based authentication.
- **File Validation**: Currently, there is no file type or size validation. You should implement proper validation based on your requirements to prevent unwanted file types or very large files from being uploaded.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.

## Troubleshooting

### Ngrok Issues:

- **`ERR_NGROK_8012`**: This error typically means that the Flask server is not running or not listening on the correct port. Make sure Flask is running on port `8000` and that Ngrok is configured to forward traffic to the correct port.
  
  **Solution**: Ensure your Flask app is running with the correct command:
  
  ```bash
  python3 app.py
  ```
  
  And start Ngrok with:
  
  ```bash
  ngrok http 8000
  ```

- **Flask Server Connection Refused**: If Ngrok can't connect to your Flask server, verify that your server is running on `0.0.0.0` and not just `localhost`. Update the `app.py` file:

  ```python
  app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
  ```

### Flask Not Found:

If you receive an error saying `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`, make sure Flask is installed using:

```bash
pip3 install flask
```

If you encounter any other issues, feel free to raise an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the maintainers.
